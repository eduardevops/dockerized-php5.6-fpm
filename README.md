Once I got a freelance job to dockerize a web application based on PHP 5.6 with MySQL database. I investigated and couldn’t find a proper PHP 5.6 Docker container, which could fully satisfy the needs of the project. I built the needed container on my own for that project both for using Apache with PHP and Nginx with PHP-FPM. After that, I thought it would be a good idea to make your life easier by sharing it publicly so that you can use it for your projects.

If you are looking for  PHP5.6 with Apache use the following project <br>
![Dockerized PHP5.6 with Apache2](https://github.com/eduardevops/dockerized-php5.6-apache)
