Once I got a freelance job to dockerize a web application based on PHP 5.6 with MySQL database. I investigated and couldn’t find a proper PHP 5.6 Docker container, which could fully satisfy the needs of the project. I built the needed container on my own for that project both for using Apache with PHP and Nginx with PHP-FPM. After that, I thought it would be a good idea to make your life easier by sharing it publicly so that you can use it for your projects.

If you are looking for  PHP5.6 with Apache use the following project <br>
![Dockerized PHP5.6 with Apache2](https://github.com/eduardevops/dockerized-php5.6-apache)

#### Components Versions
*	PHP v5.6.40
*	Nginx v1.10.3
*	MySQL v5.7.26
*	Redis v5.0.5

------

#### First things first
Before you can use this repo make sure you have ![Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and ![Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

Make sure to rename config files and their content to something that better reflects your project. In fact rename everything.
In config folder you will find files for proxying web, for both Apache and Nginx, whichever suits you the best

#### Content
The list doesn't contain git generated files and repo assets (e.g. README.md, logo.jpg)

#### HowTo
Clone repo to your server (I would recommend using /opt directory)
```less
sudo git clone https://github.com/eduardevops/dockerized-php5.6-nginx.git
```
Put your webapp/website into the 'web' folder. <br>
Navigate to the project folder and start containers

```less
cd /path/to/dockerized-php5.6-apache
docker-compose up -d
```

Check logs in real-time
```less
docker-compose logs -f
```
